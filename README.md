# Final-Project


The Industrial Anomaly Detection Project is a pivotal initiative aimed at predicting and preventing boiler failures in an industrial setting through the implementation of a machine learning-based predictive model. This project leverages historical boiler operation data, including temperature readings, operational timestamps, and boiler type identifiers, to train and validate several predictive models. The goal is to enhance safety, minimize downtime, and optimize maintenance scheduling by accurately forecasting potential failures before they occur.

# Key Components of the Project
**Data Collection and Processing**
* Data preprocessing steps include cleaning, normalization, and transformation of timestamp data into more useful features, as well as encoding categorical data like boiler names.

**Model Development and Selection**

* A range of classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, are explored and evaluated based on their ability to predict boiler failures.
* The models are trained using features such as temperature, operational hours, and boiler-specific characteristics to identify patterns and signs indicative of potential failures.

**Model Evaluation**

* Each model is rigorously tested using a variety of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure reliability and effectiveness in predicting failures.
* The models are also subjected to cross-validation to avoid overfitting and to ensure they generalize well across different operational scenarios.

**Implementation of Prediction System**

* A user-friendly Streamlit application is developed as the interface for real-time monitoring and failure prediction. This application allows users to input current boiler conditions and receive instant predictions on the likelihood of failure.
* The system provides actionable insights, enabling maintenance teams to intervene proactively and address potential issues before they lead to actual failures.

**Results and Impact**

* The project demonstrates significant potential in reducing unplanned downtime by allowing for timely maintenance actions based on predictive insights.
* The models show varying degrees of accuracy, with Random Forest performing notably well due to its ability to handle the complexity and variability of boiler data.

# Conclusion
The Industrial Anomaly Detection Project represents a critical advancement in the application of machine learning to industrial safety and efficiency. By transforming raw operational data into predictive insights, the project not only aims to safeguard equipment but also enhances operational continuity and efficiency. Future enhancements will focus on expanding the scope and accuracy of the predictive models, further integrating machine learning into everyday industrial operations.
